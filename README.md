# project-1

Adding the following imports
  pandas, pathlib= Path, matpltlib, numpy, os and warnings along with the filterwarning ignore. 

The dataframe was loaded and the data from the perspective of state and telehealth usage, along with provider population, was examined. 
The data values were sorted by State Telehealth Percentiles for the top ten and bottom ten states, and both groups were placed into a data frame. 
The data was then sorted into a data set of the top/bottom 10 to compare the number of providers and dentists per 100K.

A bar graph was created using medium blue and slateblue colors, with titles added. 
The data was sorted using the top/bottom ten to compare the number of drug-related deaths and opioid-related deaths per 100K using Telehealth. 
A stack bar graph was used to compare the difference between drug-related deaths.
However, there were issues with the small pie and large state names. 
To address this, the settings were adjusted and the ledgers were moved. 

The data was sorted again to compare the number of adults in poor or fair health in the top/bottom ten states using telehealth. 
A pie graph was created to demonstrate this. The data was also sorted to compare the number of Mental Health per 100K in the top/bottom ten states using telehealth. 
Another pie graph was created to demonstrate these values.

The Matplotlib gallery was used to learn some tricks on bar and pie charts. 
Greg did an excellent job learning how to do the state map, and the team shared ideas and codes to help each other out. 
Mica did a great job putting slides together and assisting with data and Google Docs.
